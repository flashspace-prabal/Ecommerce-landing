  {
    question: "What is a VPOB and why do I need one?",
    answer: "A Virtual Place of Business (VPOB) is a verified address that allows you to register for GST in any Indian state without having a physical office there. It's essential for e-commerce sellers who want to store inventory and sell through marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart across multiple states.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate GST registration for each state?",
    answer: "Yes. If you store inventory or have a place of business in multiple states, you need GST registration in each of those states. Our VPOB service makes this simple — we provide verified addresses and handle the entire registration process.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I sell in a state without GST registration?",
    answer: "You risk losing TCS credits, facing penalties and interest from the tax department, and potential suspension of your marketplace listings. The financial losses can run into lakhs — far exceeding the cost of proper compliance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does multi-state GST registration take?",
    answer: "With our streamlined process, we typically complete VPOB setup and GST registration in 7–14 business days per state. We handle all documentation, verification, and follow-ups with the tax authorities.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim TCS and TDS credits without state-level registration?",
    answer: "No. TCS deducted by marketplaces and TDS deducted on payments can only be claimed if you have valid GST registration in the respective state. Without it, this money is permanently lost.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help with ongoing GST filing and compliance?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer complete accounting and filing services — monthly GST returns, annual filings, TDS/TCS reconciliation, and income tax returns. Our team ensures you stay compliant across all registered states.",
  },
